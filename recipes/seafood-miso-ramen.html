            broth bases such as chicken, vegetable, or beef broth. Miso paste comes in three main varieties:
            white (mildest flavor), yellow (moderate flavor), and red (most pungent flavor). This recipe will 
            be using white miso paste. The ideal toppings for a bowl of ramen vary depending on the broth 
            flavor and an individual's preferences. This makes ramen a fun and versatile meal option.

Reflection

This project tasks programmers with making a recipe website. The site is to include links, embedded images, 
and several listing elements. The Odin Project is the source of this project idea/instructions.

This project is my very first HTML webpage. I am currently working on The Odin Project, which I started 
on January 15, 2023. I truly enjoyed building this site, and I learned a lot through the process. I even 
included my original recipes, so I'm glad to see the progress that I'm making so far. The issues that I 
encountered varied, and included problems with GitHub and broken relative links.

To expound about the first issue: When I first began this project, I had just learned the basics of filesystem 
navigation. However, after a few days, I found it much easier to find my way around my laptop's directories. Due 
to my initial disorganization, my files were in disarry. I decided to reorganize my files using the CLI terminal, and 
it went well for the most part. However, at some point after I reorganized, my relative links stopped working. Then, 
when I opened my files the next day, most of my progress from the prior day was missing! I eventually realized that 
this was because I had accidentally copied my files to another location as opposed to moving them. I also realized that 
my links were not working because my relative paths were to the duplicate folder. Once I realized I had duplicate  
files, the problem was easy to solve.
Working through this issue provided me with valuable experience with troubleshooting and the importance of attention 
to details. I also got the chance to review the commands that I learned a few weeks ago.

The second issue was easier to resolve; I was attempting to publish my project to GitHub, but I forgot to use $git push 
after I committed all of my final changes to the page. After carefully reading overmy notes on git and GitHub, I was able 
to resolve the issue. As a result, I now have experience pushing a repository to GitHub.

I have also been considering using my website practically, as a way to keep track of my recipes. I will likely add 
more as time goes on. In conclusion, this project was well worth the time.
